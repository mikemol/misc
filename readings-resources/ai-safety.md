## Key Concepts

*   **AI Alignment:** The task of ensuring that AI systems are aligned with human values.
*   **Value Alignment:**  Ensuring AI systems act in accordance with human goals and preferences.
*   **Reward Hacking:**  When an AI system exploits loopholes in its reward function to achieve high scores without fulfilling the intended goals.
*   **Inner Alignment:** Ensuring the internal decision-making processes of an AI system are aligned with human values.
*   **Outer Alignment:** Aligning the output of the system with the desired values.
*   **Interpretability and Explainability (XAI):** Making AI systems' reasoning more transparent and understandable.
*   **Adversarial Robustness:** Designing AI systems that are resistant to adversarial attacks.
*   **Formal Verification:** Using mathematical techniques to prove the correctness of AI systems.
*   **Architectural AI Alignment:** Embedding safety and ethical considerations into the *architecture* or the design of the system.
