# Category Theory Resources

This document provides a curated list of resources related to Category Theory, a foundational mathematical framework for understanding structures and relationships. These resources are particularly relevant to the framework, as Category Theory provides the formal language for describing its core principles.

## Books

*   **Category Theory for Scientists** by David I. Spivak.
    *   *Description:* A gentle introduction to Category Theory, suitable for scientists and engineers with a focus on applications. Covers core concepts and uses examples from computer science and physics.
    *   *Notes:* A good starting point for someone unfamiliar with abstract math. Good for a conceptual understanding.

*   **Category Theory in Context** by Emily Riehl.
    *   *Description:* An advanced textbook. Rigorous, yet readable introduction to the core ideas of Category Theory, suitable for students with a background in mathematics. Covers the fundamentals and explores many important constructions.
    *   *Notes:* The book can be used as a reference text.

*   **Conceptual Mathematics: A First Introduction to Categories** by F. William Lawvere and Stephen H. Schanuel.
    *   *Description:* An elementary introduction to category theory.

## Tools

*   (Add tools for learning or using Category Theory)

## Key Concepts

*   **Category:** Objects, morphisms, identity morphisms, and composition.
*   **Functor:** Mappings between categories that preserve structure.
*   **Natural Transformation:** A morphism between functors.
*   **Limits and Colimits:** Universal constructions (e.g., products, pullbacks, equalizers).
*   **Monads:** Structures for composing computations.
*   **Adjunctions:**  Relationship between two functors.
*   **Dagger Categories:** Categories with a dagger operation.
*   **Monoidal Categories:** Categories with a tensor product.
*   **Symmetric Monoidal Dagger Categories:** Those with an extra symmetry property.
*   **Pushout:** A construction that glues two objects along a common morphism.
