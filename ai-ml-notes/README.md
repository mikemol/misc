# AI and ML Notes

This directory houses my notes, explorations, and experiments related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) topics. This is a companion to the philosophical explorations, documenting my understanding of specific techniques, algorithms, and architectures, and how they relate to the broader philosophical themes of the "Architecture of Entailed Meaning" document.

## Key Areas of Focus

*   Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
*   Symbol Grounding
*   Machine Learning Architectures
*   AI Safety
*   Neuromorphic Computing
*   Model Interpretability and Explainability (XAI)
*   Specific algorithms: Examples from numerical analysis, as they relate to the G-Calculus.
