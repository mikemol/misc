# G-Calculus Implementation Notes

This document outlines the practical considerations, design choices, and experimental findings related to implementing the G-Calculus, the physicalist cognitive architecture. This includes hardware and software considerations. This is a work in progress.

## 1. Introduction: From Theory to Practice

*   **Goal:** To document the process of implementing the G-Calculus model, detailing choices around hardware, software, and experimental design.
*   **Challenges:** Energy minimization, and a continuous-time model of operation.
*   **Consider:** Describe the constraints: power, resources, fidelity.

## 2. Hardware Considerations

*   **2.1. Neuromorphic Hardware:**
    *   **Rationale:** The G-Calculus is designed to be implemented on neuromorphic hardware.
        *   **Explain:** The benefits (e.g., parallelism, low power, event-driven processing).
        *   **Consider:**  Which neuromorphic hardware platforms are most suitable (e.g., Intel's Loihi, IBM's TrueNorth, SpiNNaker, etc.)? Justify choice.
        *   **Consider:** Describe the characteristics of the platform you select, including core count, memory, communication protocols, and programming tools.
    *   **Consider:** Discuss the constraints of using available neuromorphic hardware.
*   **2.2. Analog vs. Digital Implementation:**
    *   **Choice:** Should the G-Calculus be implemented using *analog* or *digital* circuitry on the chosen hardware?
    *   **Analog Advantages:** (potentially) more energy-efficient, more direct mapping to the G-Calculus equations.
    *   **Analog Disadvantages:** Precision, scalability, noise.
    *   **Digital Advantages:** Reliability, precision, mature tool chains.
    *   **Digital Disadvantages:** Overhead, may be less energy efficient.
    *   **Consider:** Justify your choice (or exploration of both).
*   **2.3. Physical Components and Mapping:**
    *   **Resistors (R):** Representing the resistance of "neural" connections.
        *   Values and ranges to be used in the simulation/implementation.
    *   **Inductors (L) & Capacitors (C):** Modeling "belief inertia" and "doctrinal rigidity"
    *   **Consider:** How will you manage scaling (number of nodes, connections)?
    *   **Consider:**  How will you implement the *Axiomatic\_Reference\_Simplex*?
    *   **Consider:** How will you implement the *Dissonance\_Score* measurement?
*   **2.4. Sensors and Actuators (If applicable):**
    *   **Consider:** If the G-Calculus is to be integrated into a robotic or sensorimotor system, how will sensory input be processed?
    *   **Consider:** If relevant, how would the system generate actions/outputs?

## 3. Software Implementation

*   **3.1. Simulation Framework:**
    *   **Choice:** Choose a simulation environment (e.g., Python with NumPy/SciPy, Brian2, NEST, etc.).
        *   **Justify:**  Why did you choose this tool?
    *   **Model Equations:** Formalize the equations describing the G-Calculus dynamics (e.g., Kirchhoff's laws, Harmonic Mean).
    *   **Data Structures:** Define data structures for representing nodes, connections, and the state of the network.
    *   **Consider:** Include some source code here.
*   **3.2.  Algorithm for Dissonance Reduction:**
    *   **How will the system minimize the Dissonance\_Score?**
        *   (Gradient descent in the continuous-time model).
    *   Describe your *optimization* algorithm (e.g., simulated annealing, gradient descent, or other methods of searching an energy landscape)
*   **3.3. Implementing the RLC Model:**
    *   **Implement RLC elements in simulation.**
    *   **Consider:** Implement control mechanisms.
*   **3.4.  The OLOG KERNEL Interface (If Applicable):**
    *   How will the software *interface* with the OLOG KERNEL to build and manage the knowledge graph?
    *   Explain any API design or integration considerations.
*   **3.5. Formal Verification and Testing (if applicable):**
    *   What steps are taken to ensure correctness?
    *   What testing procedures will you use?

    *   **Dissonance and Conceptual Change:** Design experiments to demonstrate the system's ability to resolve dissonance.
        *   Design the experiment.
        *   Measure performance.
        *   Analyze performance against expectations.
        *   *Consider:* Explore a basic problem (e.g., logical contradiction) and then the effect on the *Dissonance\_Score*.
